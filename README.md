# Second-Final-Project-Diamond
This is my second final project from Introduction to Data Science course in college. 
The data was from Kaggle.com and consisted of 5 variables which are Price, Carat, Cut, Color, and Clarity. This project wanted to build an artificial neural network to predict the price of diamonds using other variables in the data. 
In this project, we tried to use no hidden layer and only 1 output layer. The accuracy of the model using 4 input neurons is 88.69%. 

The writer fully understands that this project is far from perfect, therefore all critiques and suggestions are welcomed.

All members of this group project are from Universitas Udayana majoring in Mathematics Studies, which are:
1. Luis Ricardo Pandiangan
2. Ragil Mona Bianca
3. Sinsin Triana Kian Q
4. Mikael Triartama Manurung
